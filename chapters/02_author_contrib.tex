\chapter{Author contribution}

This thesis is based on three research papers that have been submitted to peer-reviewed venues. Below we describe the author's specific contributions to each work.

\section*{Paper 1: When an LLM is Apprehensive About Its Answers}

\textbf{Authors}: M. Sychev, A. Goncharov, A. Grishin, D. Smorchkov, I. Molybog, A. Zaytsev

\textbf{Venue}: arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.01688, 2025

\textbf{Summary}: This paper investigates uncertainty estimation in large language models by analyzing token-level entropy patterns. We demonstrate that entropy-based features can predict answer correctness with ROC-AUC up to 0.83, and introduce a Model-as-Judge (MASJ) approach for uncertainty characterization.

\textbf{Author contribution}: The thesis author (A. Goncharov) contributed to the experimental design, implementation of entropy analysis methods, data collection and processing, and analysis of results. The author participated in developing the methodology for extracting and analyzing token-wise entropy patterns and contributed to writing the experimental sections of the paper.

\section*{Paper 2: Complexity-Aware Fine-Tuning for Efficient LLM Training}

\textbf{Authors}: A. Goncharov, M. Sychev, A. Zaytsev

\textbf{Venue}: arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.21220, 2025

\textbf{Summary}: This paper presents a complexity-aware fine-tuning pipeline that uses entropy to stratify training data and applies targeted training interventions. The approach achieves significant accuracy improvements while using 81\% less training data than baseline methods.

\textbf{Author contribution}: The thesis author (A. Goncharov) is the lead author and primary contributor. The author designed the overall methodology, implemented the entropy-based data stratification system, developed the training pipeline combining SFT and chain-of-thought distillation, conducted all experiments, analyzed results, and wrote the majority of the paper.

\section*{Paper 3: Language Steering in Latent Space}

\textbf{Authors}: A. Goncharov, E. Kondusov, A. Zaytsev

\textbf{Venue}: arXiv preprint arXiv:2510.13849, 2025

\textbf{Summary}: This paper explores the geometric structure of multilingual representations in LLM latent space. We discover that language-specific directions can be identified through PCA with 95--99\% classification accuracy and demonstrate that steering activations along these directions reduces code-switching by up to 55\%.

\textbf{Author contribution}: The thesis author (A. Goncharov) is the lead author and primary contributor. The author conceived the idea of using PCA to identify language directions, designed and implemented the steering methodology, conducted experiments across multiple model architectures, performed the analysis of results, and wrote the majority of the paper.
